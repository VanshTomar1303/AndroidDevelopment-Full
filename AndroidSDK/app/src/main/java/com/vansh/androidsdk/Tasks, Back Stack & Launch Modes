ðŸ“Œ 1. Tasks in Android
A Task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job.
Think of it like a stack of screens related to what the user is doing.
Activities in a task are stored in a Back Stack (LIFO order) â€” Last In, First Out.

Example:
User opens HomeActivity â†’ Task created â†’ HomeActivity pushed to Back Stack
User navigates to ProfileActivity â†’ pushed to Back Stack
Press back â†’ ProfileActivity popped, HomeActivity shown

ðŸ“Œ 2. Back Stack
Back Stack is like a stack of plates: last activity opened is on top.
Pressing the Back button pops the top activity from the stack.
Android manages Back Stack automatically, but you can control it with flags and launch modes.

Important Notes:
Default: Every activity is added to the Back Stack.
Use finish() to remove current activity manually.
You can manipulate the stack with Intent flags (like FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP).

ðŸ“Œ 3. Launch Modes
Launch modes define how a new activity is launched and how it interacts with the Back Stack.
You can define them in AndroidManifest.xml with android:launchMode or via Intent flags.
âœ¨ 4 Main Launch Modes
| Mode                   | Description                                                                                   | Example Scenario                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **standard** (default) | New instance is created every time                                                            | Opening multiple detail screens                       |
| **singleTop**          | If activity on top of stack â†’ reuse it, else create new                                       | Notifications â†’ opens same activity if already on top |
| **singleTask**         | Only **one instance in a task**. If exists â†’ reused and other activities above it are cleared | Main dashboard activity                               |
| **singleInstance**     | Only **one instance in the system**, task has only this activity                              | Special activity like a phone call screen             |
