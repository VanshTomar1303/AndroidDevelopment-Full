ðŸ“Œ 1. What is an Activity?
An Activity is a single screen in an Android app.
Think of it like a page in a mobile app.
Entry point of app.
Example: Login screen, Home screen, Profile screen â†’ each is an Activity.

Key points:
Activities are UI components.
Each Activity is a subclass of android.app.Activity.
You can have multiple activities in an app, and you navigate between them using Intents.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Activity Lifecycle
Android manages activities with a lifecycle to control memory, performance, and user experience.
Hereâ€™s the Activity Lifecycle diagram (text version):

onCreate() â†’ onStart() â†’ onResume()
          â†‘           â†“
       onPause() â†’ onStop()
          â†‘
       onRestart()
          â†“
       onDestroy()


ðŸ“Œ 3. Lifecycle Methods Explained
âœ¨onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
Called once when Activity is first created.
Initialize UI, variables, layouts, adapters.
Example: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

âœ¨onStart()
Called when Activity becomes visible but not yet interactive.
Example: Prepare UI elements, animations.

âœ¨onResume()
Activity is in the foreground and user can interact.
Resume paused tasks (like animations, video playback).

âœ¨onPause()
Activity is partially obscured or losing focus.
Save data, pause animations, stop heavy tasks.
Should execute fast to avoid app lag.

âœ¨onStop()
Activity is no longer visible.
Release resources, unregister receivers, save persistent data.

âœ¨onRestart()
Called if the Activity is coming back to the foreground after stopping.
Example: Return to Activity from another Activity.

âœ¨onDestroy()
Activity is being destroyed.
Clean up resources (threads, database connections, observers).


âœ¨Quick Notes
Foreground Activity â†’ visible & interactive â†’ onResume()
Background Activity â†’ not visible â†’ onStop()
Partially Visible Activity â†’ partially covered â†’ onPause()
Always save critical data in onPause() or onStop().
